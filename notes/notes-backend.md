Backend Service
This is the connection point between the ALB and your backend VMs:

It defines:

The protocol used between the proxy and backend (HTTP for ALB in this project.

The load balancing scheme (must be EXTERNAL_MANAGED for regional ALBs).

The port your app listens on (port_name = "webserver").

The backend group (a managed instance group — MIG).

The health check to determine VM readiness.

It receives the traffic after the proxy decides which service to send to, based on the URL map.





------------

HC
This is used by the backend service to continuously monitor the health of each VM in the instance group:

It sends HTTP requests (e.g., GET /index.html on port 80) to the backend VMs.

Only healthy VMs will receive traffic.

This ensures the ALB routes traffic only to responsive and healthy instances.
